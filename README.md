# simple-angular-material-example

Thank you for interest in my humble project!
It was made for my university course, to show my coursemates simple angular + material application.
In application you will see simple examples of:
* implementation of custom component,
* one-side binding `{{}}`
* two-side binding `[(ngModel)]`,
* button `onClick()` event handleling.
